# [Project: Numeral System Converter](https://hyperskill.org/projects/41)

## About
We’re all quite used to our good old decimal system of numerals. But let’s not forget that there are countless other ways to count! Whether we convert numbers from one system to another just for fun or to store large data more efficiently, a converter would be helpful. In this project you will create a mathematical helper that will help you convert numbers from system M to system N.

## Learning outcomes
Master loops and arrays, and learn how to handle errors. And besides, explore binary — one of the basic concepts in programming.

## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
- **Stage 1/6: For example**
  - Start with outputs and the binary system: print a line with an example conversion.
- **Stage 2/6: Almost an octopus**
  - Learn the basics of working with Scanner class: teach the converter to determine the last digit of the octal number, converted from the decimal system.
- **Stage 3/6: Convert decimals**
  - With the help of switch operator and prefixes, convert the number to any system of your choice.
- **Stage 4/6: Any which radix**
  - Upgrade your converter: enable it to convert numbers from and to any numeral system. Practice arrays, loops and strings.
- **Stage 5/6: Converting fractions**
  - Make it possible for the converter to work with fractions as well (that is, float and double datatypes).
- **Stage 6/6: Error!**
  - Mistakes are inevitable: teach your converter to handle them and report errors if they occur.
